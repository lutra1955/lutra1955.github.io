<TD><B>Bob, my son. Fishes a fly from when he was ten years of age. He still
knows how to catch his share. It is wonderful to share moments of trout fishing with him.

from the time that peat was harvested. The place gives a good impression how
large parts of Holland looked like a long, very long, time ago.</B></TD></TR>

laugh. Without him our fishing trips would not be the same. Quotation: "Flyfishing
is fun, but you have to have something to drink to go with it".</B></TD></TR>

<TD><B>A handfull of happiness. 
A fishing trip is looked forward to for weeks. To us, the trout do not need
to be big to give us a good time. Enjoying the nature around us adds a lot
to our pleasure.</B></TD></TR>

<TD><B>On May 30 this rudd takes, unexpectedly in an everyday canal, the
nymph. It is my biggest ever caught on fly. The marks on its body
show that it has had an adventurous life.

<TD><B>When the sun sets over the Wijde Blick, the quietude spreads over the water.
Sounds become softer, the wind disappears. Often these are the most
beautiful hours of the day.

<TD><B>September '99. A chance to fish a few hours in the highlands. The rain
came down by the carload, but still it was a very pleasant afternoon.

<TD><B>Esbjerg, October 1999. A week before the season closes, we have the
chance to fish the Holsted A for a day. The weather is dull and Gary and I have to work hard for a fish. Five brownies can't resist the fly.
We spot a woodcock and teal.</B></TD>

<TD><B>April 2000. The task group of the Royal Netherlands Navy visits Japan.
Members of JFF, Japan Fly Fishers, take me with them to the Nikko area and we
spend two days at the river. It is an unique experience. The water is crystal clear
and several Yamame and Iwana are caught.

<TD><B>March 5th, 2001. The Netherlands Task Group enters Willemstad, Curacao, Netherlands
Antilles, for a port visit. My Friend Ron picks me up late in the afternoon.
Early next morning I'm flyfishing with Wicher Akkerman. The funny thing is that we are going to
a place from which you can see our ships clearly. Large tarpons are showing in the surface.

June 16 and 17, 2001, we are visiting Brest. 15 miles away there is a little river, the Elorn.
It turns out to be a very nice river, at some places it has the looks of an English chalk stream.
I get a few trout. It is the first time for me to fish in Bretagne, and I like it a lot.
