<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<b>Friday 22 - Saturday 23 June 2001, Avon dam, Dartmoor.<br><br>
After arrival in Plymouth we have the afternoon off. Straight away to the fishing tackle shop
in Exeter street to get a day permit for tomorrow, which is valid for the rivers Plym, Tavy,
Meavy and Walkham.
The rental car is delivered at 1900 and as there was still enough time to go fishing, the decision
was made quickly. Bert, with who I share the cabin, liked to go along to have a nice walk.
In a booklet of the magazine Trout Fisherman a description of the Avon dam fishery is given.
No permits are needed, only a valid <A href="https://www.environment-agency.gov.uk" target="new">
Rod Licence of the Environment Agency</A>. The fishery is about fortyfive minutes driving from
Plymouth. At the parking lot, there is a sign indicating the fishery.

</td><td><b>
A good path was weaseling through the valley, ending at the Avon dam reservoir. The booklet 
stated that it was a walk of about a mile, but it appeared to be at least two miles. 
Anyway, it was very beautiful summer weather and the scenery is breath taking. A wonderful valley
with rhododendron in full bloom with purple flowers, ferns on the hill and a beautiful burn. It 
looked like I was walking in a book of Rodger McPhail. 
</td></tr>
</table>

When standing still, I was attacked by herds of tiny midgets. Even the bug juice
didn't help much against these little critters. I fished a #12 sedge, and that worked out fine.
I got 9 little wild brownies and had a really enjoyable evening. At half nine we walked back to the
car and went back to Plymouth.
The country roads are something that you have to see yourself. Extremely narrow, sometimes the
mirrors touch the schrub of the hedges on both sides, when driving. All kinds of plants are 
protruding from the hedge, foxglove, ragged robin, cuckooflower and a lot of white flowers.
It is really beautiful. We also spotted a grey squirrel. Funny animals. Back on board I took a
shower and went to sleep straight away. 
<table>
<tr><td><b>
Saturdaymorning early up and on my way to the Plym.
The team of the fishing tackle shop advised me to go to Bickleigh, not far from Plymouth. The
river had ginclear water. Last weekend in France, I got a leak in my waders, and it appeared that the 
attempt to repair it, was not successful. The leak was in the foot-part of the wader and can not
be repaired. Fortunately I took my wellies with me as well.
The waterlevel was very low, but even in this circumstances, you can't get around with wellies very
well. Anyway, this morning I got two little brown trout. There were some shoals of seatrout 
present in the deeper pools, but they were extremely shy. One salmon was spotted, covered with
UDN. It appeared that there were not many brown trout around in the part of the river that I fished.

</table>

At noon I took off and went back to the Avon dam. The reservoir has a stock of little wild brown
trout. An 8 inch fish is a good size. When I arrived, some fish were showing in the surface and
so I started fishing near the dam. Soon a trout rose to my fly, I missed it. Several trout splashed
at my fly, without taking it. I missed a lot more than I caught. Perhaps that a smaller size fly
would have done the trick, who knows.
After a while I changed the sedge for a goldhead-pheasanttail. It was taken soon after by an 8 
inch wild brownie, that was landed and released. A few more trout were caught. The scenery at
the reservoir is smashing. It looks like a loch that Rodger McPhail has painted so 
beautiful in his books. There is only the sounds of wind and water, apart from a sheep or cow.
It has a kind of solitude that can be very attractive at times.
 At half six I called it a day, walked back to the parking lot and returned to Plymouth.
Back on board I had a beer and went to bed at 11.

<B>Saturday Sep 11th, 1999. Ardgowan Fishery, Greenock, Scotland.<BR><BR>

Ardgowan is a little reservoir, about 37 acres. It is stocked with
rainbows and there are wild brown trout. Boats and float tubes can be rented.
<BR>
I fished the place on a rainy september afternoon. After arrival a permit was
purchased at the cabin (10, 2 fish). 
The manager advised to try it near some shrub, not far from the cabin, where several 
fish had been showing. So I went there, got me into the raintrousers 
(they were needed as it had been pouring down all day, and the rainshower that
was getting down on me was not to be the last of this day), and started to rig
the travel rod. Number 5 line, 4 lbs tippet, goldhead on a nr 12 hook.
The old waxcoat kept me nice and dry, the temperature was quite mild anyway.
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><IMG src="ardgow11.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="175"></TD>
<TD><B>While fishing I had a good look at the area. Mountains, rocks and shades of
browns and greens in a variety that you should see yourself to believe it.
Roger McPhail captures that very well in his books "Open Season" and "Fishing 
Season". Some sheep, a farm. And quietude, a wonderful quietude.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


Nobody around and nobody whining at you. Just a lovely silence, occasionally 
disrupted by the sound of a distant car. Further only the murmur of the burn,
the ticking of raindrops on the waxcoat and the call of a bird.
After an hour some fish had showed, but nothing had grabbed the fly. I decided
to try it on another spot. At the dam (a small one, only 5 or 6 metres high),
excess water ran over a concrete slab into a little burn. I asked permission
to fish the burn for a hundred yards or so and that was no problem.

<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><IMG src="ardgow33.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="175"></TD>
<TD><B>Soon it became clear why sheep have such a good time here, with all the steep
slopes it is much easier to have 4 legs instead of 2. A good deal of climbing
was involved. Once at the burn I started to fish the little pools. First with
a goldhead pheasant tail, but soon that was changed for a dry sedge pattern.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

It is a very enchanting way to fish, casting from kneeling positions and keeping
a low profile. The burn was only about two yards wide! From the pool under
the dam came four little brownies. All were carefully released. Real wild
brown trout of five inch or so. A fish of 8 inch is a specimen in a water like 
that. It was great! No hip waders were needed, wellingtons were sufficient to 
cross the burn from time to time. 

<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><IMG src="ardgow22.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="175"></TD>
<TD><B>Sometimes it is difficult to believe that
brownies can be caught from a little burn like this. I climbed a while along
the burn and raised another 5 little trout, all of them managed to shake the
hook out (barbless hook). It did not matter, it was nice to see them.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


It is very difficult fishing in circumstances like that, but to me it is
very appealing. I can deeply enjoy being out at a burn in an environment like
this and catch a 4 to 6 inch browny from time to time while absorbing the
nature around me.
Some dippers showed themselves, a typical inhabitant of a place like this.
Midges were present too (must be little beaks with wings).
On the way back to the cabin a fifth browny was caught from the pool under
the dam, and two others were missed. 
The manager had to go back to Greenock at about 8 o'clock and he promised me
to drop me at the dockyard.
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><IMG src="chaffinch3.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="175"></TD>
<TD><B>At seven I fished a while in the loch and might have had an offer of
a small brown trout, but saw no big rainbow. It didn't matter. At the cabin
a flock of finches was foraging, they came up to within a foot from my
wellies. Funny, probably they hadn't seen many people yet.</B>

wonderful environment with an abundant animal- and plant life.
The trout can be quite big, 4 Lbs or more! Wading is possible over nearly the
complete beat. There are some deeper pools where the trout can hide when the
waterlevel is very low, which can occur during late summer. Information on
accommodation, rates and such can be found on the homepage of <A HREF="http://www.goflyfishing.co.uk" target="new">

From my logbook, April 23rd 1995.
<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday we returned from Turkye, today we are off. So I went to the river 
Piddle. Because of the heavy rain the day before, the r. Frome was as brown as white
coffee. But the r. Piddle was in good condition to fish. The weather was very
nice. Later that afternoon I noticed that quite some olives were hatching, but
very few trout were rising. I started at the Culeaze farm and fished upstream.
Very soon I hooked two trout (on a nymph), but both managed to shake the hook 
out. A bit further 5 trout were niggled from under a holly tree, one after the other.
In the deep, narrow stretch, just before the little bridge at the upper end of
the beat I got my first big brown, 17 inches! A gem of a trout. Gave a good
fight during the drill as well. I hope the pictures turn out well.
From under the bridge I hooked another nice brown on a dry sedge. Between the
trout I hooked 2 salmon parr. I also saw a kingfisher, buzzard, arum, marsh marigold
and a blue flower which I did not recognize, and a roe deer.
The roe deer jumped away at the little meadow near the farm.
It was a wonderful day, lovely weather, piece and quiet, and i released some
trout.

This afternoon I went to the r. Piddle again. The water is now dead summer low and
the trout are very easily spooked. At the farm pool I get the first one, on a
gold head. I saw the trout come up and take the nymph.</B>
<TABLE BORDER=0" WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><IMG src="pidbrown.jpg"></TD>
<TD><B>Fishing upstream I get another 5 on a dry sedge. Great!</B> 
<TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><B> 
I know a big trout to ly in a deep pool. I cast the sedge against the steep
bank and it floats calmly with the current.
Then a lot of things happen at the same time. A stinging fly bothers me by
buzzing near my ear and instinctively I try to chase it away with my hand.
Doing so I have let go of my fly line. At that moment I get a massive rise on the
sedge and I KNOW that it is the whopper. Miss ....... ruddy fly.<BR>
Fishing further I get two more trout from the downstream part of the beat.
Anyway, it has been a wonderful day. I also spotted a kingfisher again.

Apart from the beats on the rivers Piddle and Frome and the Sydling brook,
Wessex Chalkstreams has some nice lakes with stocked rainbow trout.
Because the lakes are fed with water from the Piddle and from  wells, the water is
gin clear and there are enough water plants which attract insects, and fish.
I have spent some time there and had a great time every time.</B>
<TABLE BORDER=0" WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><IMG src="oxbow.jpg"></TD>
<TD><B>The Oxbow, one of the smaller lakes. Because of its structure, it looks
a bit like a part of the river.
<TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><B>
The size of stocked fish is quite good, a rainbow of 3 lbs is nothing unusual
and some are double figures.
But besides a good trout stock, the lakes are very attractive because of the
scenery in which they are situated.
The area around Dorchester is beautiful, hills and valleys with brooks and the
rivers Piddle and Frome. Dorchester itself is a nice town to check out. Don't
forget the fishing tackle shop of John Aplin, who's river keeper for the

For some time I lived near the village of Somerton. Here, in the Cary Valley,
the Viaduct Fishery is located, but it is no longer (1999) a trout fishery. 
It is now solely a coarse fishery.

<B>From the logbook, Friday January 20th 1995.
<BR><BR>
Pretty soon the fluor-goldhead was taken. The fish (a good one) was on for 1
second, turned and got away. Within half an hour I got another offer and this
one had taken the nymph properly. It turned out to be a beauty of over 3 Lbs.
Whilst landing the fish, it fell through the net!
To someone watching it must have been a wonderfull sight.
Me spasmodicly trying to hold the rod and the net in such a position
that the fish could be drilled, sort of, while the trout went ballistic and
raced away.
Well, it worked. Probably thanks to the new 5 Lbs leaderpoint.
Bought a new net in Street, later that afternoon.
<BR><BR>
Saturday, January 20th 1996<BR><BR>
About 8.30 a.m. I was at the Fishery. There was a crisp, bleak wind blowing.
Couldn't catch a fish all morning, had one that threw the fly.
After having a pie and hot chocolate for lunch, I went back to the corner with
the trees behind the little peninsula. Within one hour three trout were on the
bank. A fourth was taken in the corner back at Cary. It was pretty cold
today, but several anglers got their bag. The double figures are still out there.
