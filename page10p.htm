Wednesday May 18th.<br><br>


Last week Frans and I have watched the waterlevel of the river Kyll very carefully. It looks promising, the level of the day before the planned departure is 83 cm, and falling. Still a bit too high though. However, the weather forecast is fair, but we will probably get some rainshowers.
<br>
A quarter past six p.m. we head south. We arrive at the AC restaurant in Nederweert well before closing time so we can get a cup of coffee.
We fill the tank at the Shell station in Barchon, on the E-40. Nowadays you have to pay in advance during the evening and night.
Without delays we turn into the camping grounds at half eleven. The tent is quickly put up and than we can sit down and relax with a beer.
The <A href="http://www.gulpener.nl" target="new"><b>Korenwolf</A>, a Dutch beer from Limburg, tastes great.
<br>
Then we plunge in our sleeping bags, tomorrow there is some serious fishing to do !!! A pair of owls is hooting from the woods on the other bank.
<br><br>
Thursday May 19th.<br><br>

When we get out of the tent in the morning, the waterlevel is still a bit too high, and the water is somewhat coloured. After breakfast we first go to the Neukauf supermarket to get some groceries and a few beers for this evening. When that is done, we go on and get a permit. Here too the water is a bit coloured, but we have good confidence that it will work out anyway.
Frans takes the stretch downstream of the bridge, while I start at the bridge itself and go upstream. A bit further I get the first take, on the nymph, and my first trout of the day is caught. Brilliant !!! A few minutes later I get another take, but the trout gets away.
It appears that the trees are magnetic today, for in the mean time I have thrown several nymps into the overhanging branches. 
After an hour I get to a deeper pool and here I get a few fish, one after the other, and I am having a great time.
Behind the blacksmiths I only get one, while I expected to get a few more here.
Near a piece of grasland there is a nice pool. When I get there, a few trout are rising and the nympf is changed for a dry fly.
Casting to the nearest ring on the water, it is only shortly before the fly is taken. But then four trout in a row throw the hook out. An inspection of the fly shows that there is nothing wrong with it, but I change it anyway.

It does the trick, for now a few trout are caught. A moment later they are released and swim free again.
At lunchtime we meet at the car and we prepare our lunch. Lentil soup and fresh rolls. After lunch we move on, a bit upstream.
Frans takes the last part of the beat, while I are going to try the "wilderness".
While fishing, a steep part of the bank is passed, and some strange noises are coming from a hole. It turns out to be the nest of a Kingfisher. A few pictures are taken. Unfortenately, only a dark hole is to be seen, but none of the young Kingfishers. Then I leave them in piece in order not to disturb them, and move on.

From time to time a trout is caught. And some more nymps find their way into the trees. Today this happens unusually often. I reach the end of the beat without meeting Frans. Apparently he has walked back a bit.
<br>
Dozy a bull is watching me, standing in the field and surrounded by several ladies. It is a fine bull. In the mean time the Kingfisher has passed me a few times. Often his call is heared before you see the bird itself, which always is a beautiful sight.

Walking to the car I spot some orchids. I make a few pictures, because this is an unknown species to me.
<br>
Later it appears that they are Early-purple Orchids (Orchis mascula). It is the first time ever that I see them.
<br>
In the evening we sit in front of the tent with a beer. This time we have chosen

<A href="http://www.franziskaner-weissbier.de" target="new"><b>Franziskaner dunkel.</A> 
<b>Both taste very well. We behave terribly wise and go to sleep early.

First we get the groceries and a permit for the day. Yesterday we called to make the reservation. When we arrive the permits are lying ready and we only have to sign them before we head for the river.
The water is gin clear. Frans and I start in the usual way and very shortly after we both have the first trout in. I got it on the dry fly again which gives me great pleasure.

When we split up and I take the stretch behind the bridge, Frans already got a few more fish than I have. I works out well today.
Carefully I stalk the small pools and place the dry fly in likely spots. The fly is taken regularly, but quite a few fish manage to shake the hook out. A lot more that usual anyway. When it is three o'clock, I walk back. We prepare lunch at the picknick spot in the park in the village. Then it is good to lay back in the grass for a while, brilliant. The weather is fine, dry and about 20 Degs.

Today again I throw a lot a flies in the trees. The water is quite overgrown in most places, but the number of flies I lose, yesterday and today is very unusual. When we get back home, I will have to spend some time at the vise to bring back the stock of flies to a nice level.
When we meet again at seven thirty, we both have had a very nice day of fishing. To celebrate, we decide not to cook, but to get some chow at the "futterkrippe", the fish and chips shop. The French fries and the weisswurst taste good.

The choice for this evening is a bottle of Oetinger dark weissbeer and a bottle of Paulaner Salvator, which is a doppelbock beer. After three sips of the latter, Frans makes the remark that it tastes of liqorice. To me it is ok, but I am not really fond of it. The Salvator will be deleted from the list of our favorite beers. Next time we go again for the dark Hefe Weissbeer.
At night I wake up, there is a severe thunderstorm. White flashes light up the tent, while the rain rattles hard on the fabric. I think that this will do no good to the waterlevel and the colour. I can't do something about it, so turn over and go back to sleep.

<br><br>
Saturday, May 21st.
<br><br>
In the morning it is clear that the level has come up at least four inches and the colour has turned brownish. After a shower and brackfast, we talk things over. We decide to go and look elsewhere.

A brook is just as brown. Wherever we go, the water is brown and unfishable. Till we get to the Pr&#252m at the campingplace in Pr&#252m.
There the water is clear. Unfortenately at first there is nobody present at the reception of the camping. But a minute later a car stops and the manager arrives. He regrets it, but explains that he cannot give us a permit. It is a private beat, and even he himself is not allowd to fish there. To us, that is a real setback.<br>
We get back into the car and drive to Sch&#246necken. There the river Nims is fairly clear. But it happens not to be Frans' favourite river and we drive on to Waxweiler. The river there is brown and unfishable, so we turn back again to Sch&#246necken.

Fortunately we can get a permit, and at half past eleven we are standing at the bank. Frans goes to the pool of the poplar trees, while I bo to another little pool. Soon my strike indicator moves and the first trout, a little rainbow, is caught. Very enjoyable. A bit further I see two fish rising and quietly stalks them. I change the nymph for a dry fly and after a few casts it is taken. It turns out to be a grayling. I am pleased with it, as it is the first decent grayling since a long time. In the pool of the poplar trees there used to be a shoal of grayling, but since the cormorants have found this piece of water, none is left.

While returning the grayling after taking a picture, there is a movement a few yards away. I cast the fly and it is taken almost immediately.
When the trout comes into reach, it appears to be a little brooktrout.<br>
The Nims is a difficult little river. Difficult because it is hard to find places where you can cast, for the water is heavily overgrown on most places. Even when fishing with a worm or spinnerbait (also allowed here), you can not fish everywhere. After a while I meet Frans. He has not yet arrived at the pool of the poplar trees. I walk on, and enter the water after the pool. Under a tree there definately must be a trout. And yes, bingo, the fourth fish of today comes in. Almost, that is, because he shakes the hook out before I can land him. A few metres further I get another take and this fish is caught. I litlle brown trout. Funny, four fish and of four species so far.
After an hour or two I meet Frans again. He has not been lucky, he had some fish on, but all shook the hook out.
First we go to make lunch and then we go to the other parts of the beat.
The Nims here is in a virtually natural state. Here and there you will find trees, fallen in the water, creating a logjam.
It is a challenge to make a good cast. I don't catch much this time. At the end we decide to try the two pools once more. In the pool of the poplar trees I see a fish rising. After a bit of climbing and some demanding wading, I get into a good position and at the second cast the trout comes up and takes the fly. It is a nice sized rainbow trout. During the fight he jumps almost a metre clear of the water. Very spectacular. After taking a picture, I carefully support the fish untill it swims away into the deep. Frans has got a trout by now too.
At seven we call it a day and head back. First a shower and than we go for a meal at hotel Haus Wehrb&#252sch. The dish of the day is spiesbraten. It appeals to us and so we order it. It is preceded by a good homemade mushroom soup and icecream as desert.
The spiesbraten tastes grate, but next time we will go for the schnitzel again. After a cup of coffee it is time for the first beer.
Frans has two Franziskaner and I go for a Sch&#246fferhofer dunkel and a bottle of <A href="http://www.paulaner.de" target="new"><b>Paulaner dunkel.</A>
<b>Both taste very good.

Sunday, May 22nd.
<br><br>
Mostly we sleep in on the day of departure, but this time we get up early. After a shower and breakfast, we start packing our gear.
It goes smoothly and just after ten we head back home to Den Helder, where we arrive at half past three.
Despite some rain and high and coloured water, we managed to fish enjoyably. Again we can look back to a good trip. It was nice not to have to think of work for a few days.
