<BR>
At the end of September we had to go to Trier. A bit of research on the maps and on the internet focussed my attention to the river Ruwer.

The hotel that appeared on the screen was the <A href="http://www.karlsmuehle.de" target="new"><b>Karlsm&#252;hle</A>. An old mill, nicely situated near the river and between the vineyards.
<br>
As the answer on my e-mailed request for information if it was possible to get a permit to fish the Ruwer when one stayed in the hotel, I was directed to contact Mr Peter Geiber, the owner of the winehouse <A href="http://www.karlsmuehle.com" target="new"><b>Karlsm&#252;hle </A><b> and also the owner of the fishing rights of that stretch of river. When I called Peter, he told me that getting a permit wouldn't be a problem. And so I stood on his doorstep a few weeks later. I alse used the occasion to buy, apart from the permit, two bottles of 2005 Lorenzh&#246;fer M&#228;uerchen Riesling Kabinett. When I got home, it turned out to be a delicious wine and I felt sorry that I did not bring a few more bottles home.
<br>
Tuesday, after work, I could go fishing for just an hour or two. A bit away from the hotel I entered the river and within fifteen minutes the first fish was caught. A beautifully marked brown trout.
The Ruwer is a very nice stream, not too wide, and with the dead summer low level it was very easy to wade. From time to time I got a fish and so I was having a great time. The landscape in the Ruwer valley is beautiful, with the forests and the vineyards on the hills. A while later a grayling came to the net, it was appreciated for I had not got one in a long time.

You used to get a lot of grayling in the river Kyll, years ago. But that has all changed these days. The kingfisher showed itself a few times, what a magnificent bird.
<br>
On Wednesday there was also the opportunity to go fishing a few hours and again a few trout and grayling were caught.
After the fishing we stayed to have dinner at the hotel terrace. The trout tasted delicious, even despite that I did not catch it myself.
On the Wednesday there often are life music performances. This evening a band played very good blues. All in all a very good place to stay for a while.
