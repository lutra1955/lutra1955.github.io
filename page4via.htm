<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

For some time I lived in Queen Camel, a beatiful little village near Somerton in Somerset. 
Here, in the Cary Valley, the Viaduct Fishery is located, but it is no longer (1999) a trout 
fishery. It is now solely a coarse fishery.

<B>From the logbook, Friday January 20th 1995.
<BR><BR>
Pretty soon the fluor-goldhead was taken. The fish (a good one) was on for 1
second, turned and got away. Within half an hour I got another offer and this
one had taken the nymph properly. It turned out to be a beauty of over 3 Lbs.
Whilst landing the fish, it fell through the net!
To someone watching it must have been a wonderfull sight.
Me spasmodicly trying to hold the rod and the net in such a position
that the fish could be drilled, sort of, while the trout went ballistic and
raced away.
Well, it worked. Probably thanks to the new 5 Lbs leaderpoint.
Bought a new net in Street, later that afternoon.

Saturday, January 20th 1996<BR><BR>
About 8.30 a.m. I was at the Fishery. There was a crisp, bleak wind blowing.
Couldn't catch a fish all morning, had one that threw the fly.
After having a pie and hot chocolate for lunch, I went back to the corner with
the trees behind the little peninsula. Within one hour three trout were on the
bank. A fourth was taken in the corner back at Cary. It was pretty cold
today, but several anglers got their bag. The double figures are still out there.
