<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<b>Lechlade, 4 and 9 december 2004.<br><br>

Saturday december 4th<br><br>

During the weekend we are off and after I dropped my collegue in town to go shopping, I drive on towards Lechlade. On the internet it was indicated that there must be a trout fishery there.<br>
It turnes out to be more than an hour driving, but the A40 is a nice road so it does not bother me. It reminds me of the A303 that I used to drive home on. A scenic landscape of pretty hills and some bushy stretches every now and then. When I come closer to Lechlade, it becomes quite foggy. But the trout fishery is well pointed out and after I have parked the car, I walk to the shop. Jason, one of the managers, gives me some tips while he writes out my permit.

The choise is made for Bushyleaze lake. You can catch a larger number of fish there (the stocked size is a bit smaller). A four fish ticket shoud do.
When I park the car at the parking lot at the lake, it is so foggy that I can not see the other bank. I do see a Red-crested Pochard. Perhaps one that has escaped, difficult to tell. In Holland they are pretty rare.
After I've rigged the old travel rod (#4-5, 7 feet, 5 sections) with a #5 line, I tie a goldhead pheasanttail at the point. That should do the trick. There are a number of anglers about, it appears that an angling club has a fishing day. Several anglers already have got one or more good sized trout. I find a place a bit further down, netxt to a birch tree. The little bay looks very appealing to me.

When I have cast out for the first time, I let the nymph sink down while get my permit and read the rules. Then I start a slow retrieve and immediately the strike indicator disappears from the surface. When the line is tightenend, it looks I'm stuck to the bottom, but not for long. After a drill of several minutes a beautiful rainbow trout is landed. Later, when weighing in, the fish turnes out to be 5-&#189 lbs. Not bad, such a beautiful fish on your first cast and at a five pound tippet.

Jason advised me to fish very slowly. It is good to accept such advise and by letting the line drift by the wind, the nymph could be fished extremely slow. After a while the strike indicator shows a little bit of movement, but this trout outsmarts me and it is not hooked.
A bit later the indicator shows a firm take and this trout puts up a good fight. Not surprisingly because its weight is about four lbs. You surely can feel your arm after such a drill. Needless to say that I am having a great time.

The thirth trout is quick to follow. It this is going on, my limit soon will be reached. I quit for a while and go to the clubhouse to get a cup of coffee. The fog has lifted a bit and the other bank can be seen now. A good time to take few more pictures.<br>
After coffee and something to eat, I start fishing again. Soon after I get a good take and after a nice fight trout number four is on the bank. It is only three o clock and I am not really in the mood to go back to the hotel. I hand my fish over to Jason (I can not take them home, the Airline considers my luggage too heavy as it is).

After getting a ticket to get two more fish I'm back at the water. Within a few minutes I am fishing and again it does not take long before I get a nice take. When the trout comes close it shakes the hook out. It is ok, it has deserved its freedom. Within half an hour another four trout get away. I am puzzled, an inspection of my nymph does not show anything wrong. The next trout comes to the bank, also one of about four lbs. It is getting dark by now and it is difficult to see the strike indicator. I get two more takes and the fish get away straight after the take. When I reel in, the hook turnes out to be bend out completely. No wonder that those last fish got away.
<br>
Anyway, it has been a great day. I don't think I have ever got 5 trout of this size on one day.

On sunday my colleague and I go sightseeing. We visit the villages of Bourton-on-the-water and Bribury. Real nice places. In Bribury there is a trout farm and apparently some fish have escaped and found themselves a nice place in the river Coln. Standing from the stone bridge you can see them standing in the current. As it turnes out, the fish are fond of peaces of a muesli bar. We go to the troutfarm to get some trout pellets and go back to the bridge. It is like feeding carp, what a spectacle. The <A href="http://www.cotswold-inns-hotels.co.uk/property/the_swan_hotel?/swan" target="new"><b>

Thursday december 9th
<br><br>
After we finished our exams, we are off for the rest of the day. The procedure of last saturday is repeated. First to drop my colleague off in town and I go on to Lechlade. Today Richard is the manager who writes the permit. Once again a four fish ticket.
The weather is considerably better than last weekend, it is a bit cloudy, but the air is cool and crisp and even the sun appears from time to time. Of course I start at the same place I fished last time, but today I don't have any takes in 45 minutes and I move on a bit.
A kingfisher flies low over the water towards me and finds itself a place on a branch nearby. Wonderful bird. It does not stay for long, though.

I try my luch at several places, without any success. So I go back a bit. The water is gin clear and in front of my feet there is a bank of waterplants. While I think about changing my tippett and try and fish a bit deeper, I get a nice take and after a few minutes the first trout comes in. A gentleman walks by and we talk for a while. He tells me that a few rod lengths in front of me there is about 12 feet of water. I thank the gentleman for the information and change the tippett for a longer one. When I cast out, the nymph is taken on the drop. Trout number two comes in. In the next hour I get two more and so my limit is reached.

It is four o'clock now and it has been enough. Now I can drive back during dusk instead in total darkness. After weighing the fish three of them turn out to be four lbs or above. The last one brings the scale to 2 lbs 12 oz. I hand my fish over to another angler, who is pleased with them. When driving back, Jason and Richard are stocking fish and I stop for a few minutes for a chat and then drive back to the hotel.
