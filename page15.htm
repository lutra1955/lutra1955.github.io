The evening rise is a comprehension for the troutfisherman with the dry fly. It is waited for
and if it does not appear, will always be felt as a dissappointment.

During a long weekend to the Belgian Ardennes, we ended up in Hotel Restaurant Le Point de Vue, 
in Chiny.
From the dining room and from the terrace this hotel has a magnificent vieuw over the Semois
valley. The owners, Frank and Tjakina, welcomed us very friendly. The dinners, prepared by
Frank, really were delicious.
<br>
To fish the Semois at Chiny, you need a gouvernment fishing licence for the Wallon region. This 
Permis de Peche (Region Wallon) is sold at the postoffice in Florenville or other places in
the area. There are 2 different licences. The first one costs 500 BEF and permits you to fish
from the bank.

The second licence costs 1500 BEF and permits the owner to fish while wading, from the bank, from
a boat or from a pier.<br>
Apart from the licence, a permit is needed. Less than 1 kilometer from the hotel you will find an
old mill at the St Nicolas bridge (Pont St Nicolas). Here permits are sold.

To fish the Semois between Herbeumont and Bohan, you only need the licence. Amongst others, there
are trout, grayling and chubb in the river.

There are lots of things to see and to do in the region. We visited the abbey of Orval and found
that pretty neat. In this abbey lovely beer and cheese are made. The abbey has its own
