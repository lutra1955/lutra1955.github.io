In cases like this the internet is very useful. Weeks before departure I try to find as much information as possible. Someone once remarked that trying to find information on the internet is like trying to drink water from a firehose. He was right. There is so much information to be found, that it is difficult to filter out the useful bits and pieces.
Anyway, at some stage in the process the website of the Shenandoah National Park pops up. It lookes great. And when I sent a mail to 
<A href="http://www.murraysflyshop.com" target="new"><b>Murrays Flyshop</A><b> with the request for advise on where to go fishing, the reply is given quickly.
There even appears to be a Bass Pro shop near the hotel and the Patapsco Valley State Park looks not too far away either. But we plan to go to the Shenandoah National Park because Willem and Epco can pick their choice from the many hiking trails there.
When we land at Washington Dulles International, it is raining cats and dogs. Quickly we pick up the rental car and head for the hotel.

On the way we notice that everything is green here, while at home the first leaves are just starting to show at the still bold trees.
The evening of arrival we go to the <A href="http://www.basspro.com" target="new"><b> Bass Pro Shop. </A><b> &nbsp; When I enter the store, my mouth drops. Without any doubt it is the biggest outdoor shop I ever laid eyes on. What they have in stock is unbelievable. All aspects of outdoor life are here, from camping, hiking, climbing to hunting and fishing. A complete airplane is hanging from the ceiling. I don't think that there is a shop like this in all of Europe (if there is, tell me where please).
On their website I had noticed some nice things, so of course I got some stuff there.

Sunday April 23rd 2006, Shenandoah National Park.
<br><br>
Fortunately the weather has improved. But when we pass Manassas Battlefield Park, the rain pours down on us again. When we pass a few rivers, they are all brown. I hope that the rivers in the Shenandoah National Park are still clear. We are lucky and the weather changes, after a while the sun appears again. In Sperryville we go for a coffee and a sandwich. By now the weather is very enjoyable, about 70 degrees and, very important, it is dry.
Above us several turkey vultures are soaring. Nice to see. And here, in the shrub a pair of Red Cardinals potter about.
The water is still fairly clear, to my great releave. After lunch we go to the entrance station, where we pay the 15 dollar fee to get into the park. It is no problem that Willem and Epco go hiking, while I go fishing in a different spot, says the ranger. I already purchased the fishing licence for the state Virginia at home via the internet.
Under the roof of the entrance station a few pairs of barn swallows are nesting. It is the same species (Hirundo rustica) as we are familiar with in Europe.
Then we find a parking spot and I rig my old faithful travel rod and get into my waders.

While my two colleagues are still watching, I catch the first little brooktrout. It really makes me happy, this is what I came for. It is a beautiful litlle fish to see, with sparkling yellow and red dots. Locally it is called speckled trout. A bit later I catch another one, which also is released carefully. Epco has made a movie of it with his camera. Then they leave to find a hiking trail, and I fish on in all rest and peace.
The brook is very narrow and completely wild. No pruning of shrubs or keepering of the stream here. Here and there fallen trees ly across the stream. Every now and then I catch a small brookie from a little pool. I enjoy the fishing.

The mountain streams of Shenandoah National Park provide some of the best protected strongholds for native eastern brook trout. 
Where the road crosses the stream, there is a pool that is a litlle bit bigger. There must be some trout here, I think. And indeed there are.
A bit further upstream, a little trout comes up to grab my dry fly, but I see the fish come up, react too quickly and pull the fly away from his mouth. A second time he refuses to take it.
I change to a nymph that was give to me by <A href="http://www.hans-hilgers.de" target="new"><b>Hans Hilgers </A><b>&nbsp; I have promised him to test them. On the second cast the nymph is taken and I catch a beautiful brookie. Some of them have the brightest orange bellies you can imagine.

Hans' nymphs are great, and tied very well. In most of the occasional pools I come acroos, I can seduce a trout with it.
<br>
While fishing, every now a bright yellow and black coloured butterflies passes by. They look a bit like the swallowtails (Papillio machaon) we occasional see in Belgium or Germany. When I look them up afterwards, they turn out to be Eastern Tiger Swallowtails (Papillio glaucus).
We have agreed to be back at the parking lot by six o'clock. So just after five I start to make my way back. In the mean time I think I have moved two kilometers away. I can feel my knees and back while I walk and climb back. I am back a bit early, and make a few casts downstream of the parking, but get no more takes. When I sit on a big boulder, after a while Willem and Epco arrive. They too have had a very nice afternoon, hiking a trail.

Our intention is to go back north via the Skyline drive, a route that runs through the park from north to south, and is 105 miles long.
At Front Royal we can then join highway 66 and drive back to the hotel. Skyline drive turns out to be a very scenic rout, living up to its name. You will find here the most beautiful views on the Shenandoah valley and the blue ridge mountains. Suddenly we spot two deer alongside the road. Epco carefully slows down and near the deer we stop. They are not at all shy and come to very close to the car, so we can have a vey good look at them. Brilliant !!
To our surprise we see 14 deer on this within 10 miles or so, plus several grey squirrels.

Unfortunately the black bears that liver here do not show up. A pitty, but that was to be expected as an encounter with a black bear is reported to be very rare.
<br>
It is already dark when we leave the park at Front Royal. We can look back to a fantastic day.

Tuesday April 25th 2006, Patapsco Valley State Park.
<br>
<br>
<b>
After the meeting there is time to go fishing for an hour, before we are having dinner. On the map I have seen that the Patapsco river must be nearby. The Patapsco Valley State Park runs along the river for 32 miles. And indeed, the river is only 10 minutes away. It is difficult to find a place to get to the river. When I have found one, the water is too deep for me to wade. After a few casts I quit. A bit back I have seen a smaller stream, but the water appeared to be brown. And when I get there, that is the case. When I walk to the bridge, a police car stops next to me, and the officier likes to see my licence.

When I show him my licence, we talk a bit and he advises me to go a few miles upstream. Two weeks ago trout was released there and last week the season opened. He tells me that the water migh be clearer there too. After trying the brown creek for five minutes, I get into the car and try to find the place that the sherriff told me. After a bit looking around I find the park entrance. I put the entrance fee in the little box and a few minutes later I am at the parking lot. When I passed the bridge, I saw two other flyfishermen, so that gives hope.

Here the river is wide and the water is clear. It lookes very appealing. I start fishing and calmly make cast after cast, while enjoying the scenery. There are no fish rising, so I have put on a little goldhead pheasanttail nymph. A few Canada geese fly by and land on the water behind me. When it is about seven thirty, I come to a spot where a tree stands at the water edge. I want to make a cast under the branches. The line dangles behind me when I wade into position and when I want to make the cast, a trout is already on. A nice rainbow, and I am very pleased with it. After taking a picture it is carefully released. Fifteen minutes later I quit fishing, to be back in time for dinner with Willem and Epco.

The next day I want to try for an hour before we leave, but the park is opening at nine in the morning so I find myself for a locked gate. There is no more time, so I drive back to the hotel to pack my luggage.
