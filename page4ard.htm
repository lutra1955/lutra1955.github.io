<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<B>Saturday Sep 11th, 1999. Ardgowan Fishery, Greenock, Scotland.<BR><BR>

Ardgowan is a little reservoir, about 37 acres. It is stocked with
rainbows and there are wild brown trout. Boats and float tubes can be rented.
<BR>
I fished the place on a rainy september afternoon. After arrival a permit was
purchased at the cabin (10, 2 fish). 
The manager advised to try it near some shrub, not far from the cabin, where several 
fish had been showing. So I went there, got me into the raintrousers 
(they were needed as it had been pouring down all day, and the rainshower that
was getting down on me was not to be the last of this day), and started to rig
the travel rod. Number 5 line, 4 lbs tippet, goldhead on a nr 12 hook.
The old waxcoat kept me nice and dry, the temperature was quite mild anyway.

<TD><B>While fishing I had a good look at the area. Mountains, rocks and shades of
browns and greens in a variety that you should see yourself to believe it.
Roger McPhail captures that very well in his books "Open Season" and "Fishing 
Season". Some sheep, a farm. And quietude, a wonderful quietude.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


Nobody around and nobody whining at you. Just a lovely silence, occasionally 
disrupted by the sound of a distant car. Further only the murmur of the burn,
the ticking of raindrops on the waxcoat and the call of a bird.
After an hour some fish had showed, but nothing had grabbed the fly. I decided
to try it on another spot. At the dam (a small one, only 5 or 6 metres high),
excess water ran over a concrete slab into a little burn. I asked permission
to fish the burn for a hundred yards or so and that was no problem.

<TD><B>Soon it became clear why sheep have such a good time here, with all the steep
slopes it is much easier to have 4 legs instead of 2. A good deal of climbing
was involved. Once at the burn I started to fish the little pools. First with
a goldhead pheasant tail, but soon that was changed for a dry sedge pattern.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

It is a very enchanting way to fish, casting from kneeling positions and keeping
a low profile. The burn was only about two yards wide! From the pool under
the dam came four little brownies. All were carefully released. Real wild
brown trout of five inch or so. A fish of 8 inch is a specimen in a water like 
that. It was great! No hip waders were needed, wellingtons were sufficient to 
cross the burn from time to time.

<TD><B>Sometimes it is difficult to believe that
brownies can be caught from a little burn like this. I climbed a while along
the burn and raised another 5 little trout, all of them managed to shake the
hook out (barbless hook). It did not matter, it was nice to see them.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


It is very difficult fishing in circumstances like that, but to me it is
very appealing. I can deeply enjoy being out at a burn in an environment like
this and catch a 4 to 6 inch browny from time to time while absorbing the
nature around me.
Some dippers showed themselves, a typical inhabitant of a place like this.
Midges were present too (must be little beaks with wings).
On the way back to the cabin a fifth browny was caught from the pool under
the dam, and two others were missed. 
The manager had to go back to Greenock at about 8 o'clock and he promised me
to drop me at the dockyard.

<TD><B>At seven I fished a while in the loch and might have had an offer of
a small brown trout, but saw no big rainbow. It didn't matter. At the cabin
a flock of finches was foraging, they came up to within a foot from my
wellies. Funny, probably they hadn't seen many people yet.</B>

Hopefully the pictures turn out well, and give a good idea of the atmosfere.
