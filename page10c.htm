<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

Thursday June 24.

<BR>
At last, this day has come, we have looked forward to it long enough.
The weather is beautiful and the forcast promises fine weather for the next
days. Once I caught my first trout on fly here at the Kyll river and although
I have seen it here change into a crowded place, the river is still appealing
to me.
<BR>
We took the afternoon off. Loading the car (the old Volvo of my father) was
somewhat of a hassle because Frans' new bungalow tent turned out to be a lot
bigger than estimated. However, with a bit of moving our kit around, Frans
managed to get the lot in the car and we went on our way to the South.
Fortunately there were no traffic jams and we reached Nederweert in time to
take a break and a cup of coffee. After fuelling up in Belgium we arrived
around half five, in time to get a licence for my son Bob. Next stop was the
teller machine and soon after we arrived at the camping ground.
The water looked fine. First thing to do was to get the big tent up, which
turned out to be a most luxurious housing. Three "bedrooms" and enough space
to cook and sit.
In the mean time we had gotten a bit of an appetite and the still unforfilled
promise of "Schnitzel" could be redeemed. At a hotel we enjoyed a wonderful
meal and a few beers. After another beer in the tent, we hit the sack.

It is wonderful summer weather. After an early rise and a decent breakfeast,
prepared by Frans, with fried tomatoes, bacon and eggs, we first went to the
super market to get us some of the white beer we like so much.
Unfortenately the  
<A href="http://www.franziskaner-weissbier.de">Franziskaner Hefe Weissbier</A>
was not sold anymore, but now they had another brand: 
<A href="http://www.schoefferhofer.de">Schoefferhofer Hefe Weizen.</A>
which turned out to be a fine beer too.
When the administrative affairs were taken care of, we went fishing.
In a very short time several flies were lost into the trees. My leaderpoint
of 2 lbs turned out to be very fragile. Better take a 3 lbs point.
Anyway, soon I managed to get a trout, Great!
The fish cooperated and a few fish were landed before lunchbreak.
Frans had his fish too, only Bob was not so lucky.
After lunch Bob and I went to another stretch and there he soon got a trout
and a grayling.

After our tea we went to another spot for the evening rise and in a quite
stretch near the bridge at the parking spot, a few fish were caught.
The beers tasted great, while we were watching the fireflies passing by our
tent.

Early up again, beautiful warm weather. The fish did not bite as eagerly as
the did yesterday, but about eight were released before luch. Among them a
chubb of 50 cm, the biggest one I ever got.
Bob got his share of fish and had a great time too.
Lunch with soup and fresh rolls was enjoyed at the car. I had to take a
sanitary stop, took the paper and walked into the wood, it seemed that there 
was no other human activity in miles around.
At a critical time i found out that that assumption was not correct. A group
of people came marching into my direction. For someone watching it should have
been a very amusing vieuw, with my pants on my ankles I hopped to a thick 
tree to take cover. Well, I hate to be disrupted at times like this.
After lying down in the gras for an hour, while buzzard and kestrel or hobby
soared above us, we went on fishing. The kingfisher showed itself again, very
pleasing for we really missed it last year. Dippers came along as well.
After tea it turned out that Bob had outfished me this day, and I witnessed
him catching a beautiful grayling. Frans had done well too and was a happy man.
The beers at the tent tasted great again.

The last day. After breakfast and washing up the dishes, we went to a rought
part of the beat. It is very difficult to wade here, but we like to fish this
strech. It is the trick to cast your dry fly in the little trickle that runs
between two stones. Sometimes there is a trout there and it is very rewarding
when you manage to outsmart it. This morning I got a few fish, Bob got some too.
Frans had a bad day, threw his leader into knots and other misery. He released
one trout.
