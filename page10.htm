<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

Earlier we had planned to go troutfishing in the river Kyll during the week of 13 to 17 august.
If the weather should be foul, we could go later. But the weatherforcast was very good and we
dicided to go!!
<br>
Monday august 13th we drive the fimiliar route via the Belgian Ardennes. The traffic is very
quiet and it takes us half an hour less as usual. When the tent is put up, we go out for a meal, a
delicious German schnitzel. After dinner we continue getting our kit in the tent and shortly
after we can sit down and enjoy a beer. We sit as kings in front of Frans' bungalowtent.
Tuesdaymorning we get up early, we are here to fish !!! First we go to the town hall to get a new
fishing licence, followed by a visit to the supermarket. Then we get our permits and so we have
all the necessary papers to go fishing. First we go to a rough section of the river. Wading is
killing here because of the uneven river bed and the big boulders. Soon I get my first trout.
However, this morning for some reason I cast my fly in the shrub from time to time, or throw
my cast in a Gordian knot. Unaware, a squirrel moves about on the riverbank, taking no notice
of me at all.

The morning is ended with 2 trout. Not many. Frans has got 3, he tells me when we meet at the car.
After lunch we go to another beat, but the trout are not in a taking mood and we catch little.
But we are enjoying the fishing anyway. The weather is beautiful, warm summerweather, as 
forcasted. Several Ephemeroptera species are showing, amongst them a fairly small yellow one and
a mayfly that is bigger in size, a creamcoloured body with dark bands and a three pointed tail.

At a bank with pebbles, some brown mayflies with two tailpoints are swarming. Perhaps 
"Summer duns" or "Sepia duns" or -spinners?. 
In the evening a lot of sedges are active. By the way, I am convinced that my dry "poldersedge"
is taken for a mayfly, especially if I have put the wings together with a bit of grease.
At the end of the afternoon we return to the tent, we lay down for a while and prepare our
tea. Rice with goulash. It is becoming a traditional food on our fishing trips.
Later we choose a beat that is easy to wade. I catch another trout, two miniature grayling and 
some schneider. Frans has got some fish too, most schneider.

There are no signs of an evening rise and at dusk we stop fishing. Time for a delicious German
beer,  Loewenbrau weizen and Franziskaner dunkel.
While we are sipping our beers, an owl is calling from the woods on the opposite bank. There is
a wonderfull sky, full of stars. We enjoy the moment.

Next morning we are up early and after a great breakfast, cooked by Frans, we get a permit for
the day. I fish a fast piece of water and release several fish. Frans moved upstream a bit and
has got his share. But despite that we don't catch a lot, we are having a good time fishing and
being at the river.

A kingfisher flies by, I was already missing him. Dippers are spotted and greater yellow
wagtails are showing themselves regularly. It is warm today, over 90 degrees. In the evening
we fish the same beat as yesterday, but again we are not catching much.
After the fishing we are appreciating the beer. This time we have,

<A href="http://www.paulaner.de" target="new">Paulaner dunkel</A> and we end with a

Great beers!!

Thursday we decide to go fish another beat.
After purchasing the permit, we go to the river and soon the first fish are caught. Mainly
chubb and schneider. We use the lunch at the river bank. By now the sky is clouded and shows
a promise of a rain- or thundershower. We get the rainjackets from the car. Smart idea for
an hour later we're in a severe rainshower. Sitting on a stone I wait till it gets dry again.
At six we go to the restaurant for a meal, a good jaegerschnitzel. After the coffee we quickly
go back to the river to fish again.

When we overvieuw the results of the day it appears the we both got chubb and schneider.
But I released 4 brown trout too and 2 small dace. I'm very happy with the trout.
The chubb were not large this time, the big ones didn't want to play ball.
Today the kingfisher passes us a few times and in the evening the owls are hooting from the
forest again.
Fridaymorning we let the tent dry and drive back to Holland. A lot of people are returning from
their vacation and we enjoy the delights of a good traffic jam. The ride takes an hour longer
then usual.

Looking back we feel that although we didn't get many trout, we enjoyed the fishing, the 
environment and the beautiful summer weather.
As a bonus, when we are nearly home, a hobby makes a low fly by in front of the car.
