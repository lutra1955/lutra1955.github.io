<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

Wednesday June 5th.<br>
The German weather website of <A href="http://www.donnerwetter.de" target="new"><b>Donnerwetter</A>
predicted good weather already for a week.
Just before we left the forecast became less prosperous, and it was clear that we would get some
rain at least. But after talking things over, we decided to go anyway.
We left at 1800 and as if by miracle, we didn't end up in any traffic jam at all, so after the
coffeebreak at Nederweert and topping up gas in Belgium, we arrived at the camping just after
eleven o'clock. The bar was still open and we decided to get a beer first. A good decision, because
the manager had a day off next day, and fortunately now we could get our permits.
After setting up the tent we could sit down, relax and enjoy a beer.
 
<br><br>Thursday June 6th.<br>
Early rise. After one of Frans' famous breakfasts (bread with fried egg, bacon and tomato, accompanied
by coffee), we went fishing. As usual we first tried the rought part. Soon we were successfull.
There is some trout there, but the wading is killing.
The weather was fine. Clouded, but some sunshine at regular intervals.
After lunch we tried another stretch of river and there too we managed to catch and release some
trout and schneider.
We didn't spot any kingfisher but did see a dipper. In the evening we fished another part of the
river and got a few little trout. I ended the day with a score of 9 released brownies and 6 schneider.
In the evening we enjoyed a few bottles of whitebeer. The dark Paulaner was my favourite this time.
We were a bit tired and slept within a few seconds after getting into our sleeping bags.
During the night it started to pour down with rain. We feared for bad conditions next day.
<br><br>Friday June 7th<br>
We slept in after all the rain of last night. The river was at least two inches higher.
Fortunately the water was just a bit coloured, but still good to fish. We were very releaved.
We fished another spot and that turned out to be a good choise. Some trout, chubb, schneider and
even nase could not resist our flies. It was dry nearly all day. Today once more no trace of
any kingfisher. We went to the hotel for a schnitzel and enjoyed the meal a lot.
We had a very nice day of fishing, being at the riverbank in a relaxed way.
<br><br>Saturday June 8th<br>
This morning we went to check out the new bicycle path through the railway tunnel, and fished the
beat at the other side. Once more we had good weather, when it was sunny it was even nice and
warm. The trout and even a grayling had a good appetite for our flies. Maybe because there still
were a lot of mayflies around. Large and medium sized yellow ones and ones with a large white body
with dark bands. Sedges were swarming under the branches in large numbers.
There was no evening rise, but we got some fish nevertheless.
<br><br>Sunday June 9th.<br>
We were able to pack the tent after it dried. Half past eleven we went on our way and a few minutes
past five we were back home.
We kunnen terug kijken op een
We can look back to a very nice trip. We enjoyed being in the nature of the Eifel mountains and had
very pleasant fishing. We also enjoyed the evenings, sitting in front of the tent with a white
beer.
Although the kingfishers did not show themselves, we spotted some dippers and yellow wagtails.
On the way home we saw a red kite two times. Nice, because in our home area, the Noordkop in Holland, 
they are not present.
Op de terugweg zagen we tot twee keer toe een rode wouw, leuk, want bij

As usual these days passed way too quickly, but we are already looking forward to a next trip.
