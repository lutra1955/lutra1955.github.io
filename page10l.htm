Wednesday august 27th we leave Den Helder at 11.45 and two and a half hour later we are drinking
coffee in the AC-restaurant at Nederweert. Half an hour later we move on and fill up with gas at
the Shell station in Barchon, Belgium.
Bad luck, two kilometers further we get stuck in a massive traffic jam. An accident has happened
near Battice and the motorway is closed. The police is guiding the traffic to a secondary road and
soon we are stuck again. We take an alternative route and while Frans is driving, I'm reading
the map and try to get us back on track. At Verviers we join the motorway E42 again. We see no
commercial traffic and think that our detour was a smart move. However, we have lost a lot of
time and realise that there will be no time left to go fishing this evening.
At Prm we leave the motorway to get a permit. A bit after eight we arrive at the camping ground
and at nine we are sitting in front of the tent with a beer.
<br><br>
Thursday we get up early, at seven, for we have to get another permit for the brook.
We arrive in time and the permits are lying ready for us. I wade out at the bridge at the 
camping ground and Frans moves down a bit further. As soon as my fly and line touch the water I
can see the trout scatter. They appear to be as line-shy as can be. Probably by the very low
water level. This summer has been very dry all over Europe.

After a while I catch my first trout. When I meet Frans, he has already got three. I pass under
the bridge and start fishing along the meadow while Frans goes to try his luck at the wooden bridge.
Whatever I try, I find it very difficult to catch a trout today. When we meet at half one at the
car, my score is 5. Still, I have fished and enjoyed myself quite well. I sat down on a stone
for a while, watching a few nuthatch move around. I bit later they got company of a treecreeper.
I also spotted a kingfisher a few times, and a few marsh- or willow tits.
Frans has got a lot more fish than I did today. We fill up the car and get some beers and
sausages. We find a kind of beer that we have not seen before:

evening.

At noon we prepare lunch and lay down in the grass for a while, watching a pair of buzzards, a
red kite and a kestrel.
Then we walk in the direction of the power cables. The beat ends where they go over the river.
The river has very steep banks and is heavily overgrown ("lightly keepered") and unfishable for
large parts. But when Frans finds a place to get into the water, I watch him catch his first 
trout in this river within minutes.

I move a bit upstream and try to find a place where I can make a cast. It's hard to find. The
appearance of a kingfisher brings me in a good mood. After trying hard, at last I get a trout.
After a while trying at various places, Frans and I come to a part where I have fished a few
weeks before. Soon I get a second trout in a piece of fast water. In the "pool of the big trout"
I spot several grayling. Three or four of them are over 20 inch. While I try if they are to be
seduced by a nymph, the big trout appears from nowhere and races past me. It is a real whopper and
must be over 4 lbs.
Under the bridge I get a third brown. It comes to get my dragging sedge !!!!
Frans makes a few casts in the pool of the big trout and when I meet him, he has gotten a nice
trout on a little streamer. While I watch him fish the streamer slightly faster that the current,
a trout moves out from under a tree and grabs it. Seconds later it shakes the hook out, pitty.
<br><br>
We decide to get a hamburger and fries instead of cooking a meal ourselves and go back to the brook
afterwards. There Frans gets another trout. Although I fish up to the border of the beat, I can't
seduce another trout.
The Oettinger beer we drink, sitting in front of the tent, tastes great. That's a keeper anyway!
<br><br>
Friday august 29th.
<br>
Today we try our luck on another spot. While we drive up, a really heavy rainstorm breaks loose
and we fear the worst. When we come to the river, it appears to be coloured, but still fisheable and
we decide to get a permit. Maybe the weather clears up a bit. After getting the permit we go
down to the river and tackle up. And another heavy rainstorm pours down on us. We try to fish
anyway. I enter the water at the meadow behind the blacksmiths workshop. The water has turned
brown and fishing is useless. Against all odds I fish a little black streamer and to my surprise
a little brown trout grabs it two times, without me hooking it. When I go back to the car, Frans
is already there. We intend to go and try if the Kyll at Birresborn is still good. When we get
there, the water is still clear. We go back to the camping ground, get a permit and go fishing at
the killing fields. It is quite obvious that the water level is at dead summer low. In ten minutes
or so I get my first trout on a dry sedge pattern. I try hard to get one more, but it doesn't
come easy. When I get to a little pool in front of a big stone, I see how a trout comes up to
the fly and takes it confidently. It turnes out to be one of a nice size and beautiful colours.
I get out of the water and walk to the spot where a piece of concrete lies in the river. Wading
is very hard there too because of the big rocks on the bottom (hence the name killing fields).
I fish up to the big pool, but when I get there I'm still without a fish more. I ty a little black
streamer on and start fishing downstream. A while later a trout grabs it, but shakes out the hook
a few seconds later. I am not pleased. A bit further another trout hits the streamer, and this
fish comes in. When I carefully hold it to my rod (an old Hardy "Midge"), it's beak comes up to
the letters "Midge". Later it turns out to be 36 cm. Nice fish. I release it carefully.
Frans ends this evening with two trout, and a few that got away. Also on s streamer pattern.
<br>
This evening we enjoy Franziskaner and Paulaner beers, both in the dark variety. We find nothing
wrong with them.

After getting a permit and a cup of coffee, we go to the river. Frans starts fishing at his usual
place and I go a bit further on. I start fishing at a fast peace of water. A fifteen minutes later
I still have gotten no take and I change to a nymph. A few minutes later I catch my first fish
of the day, a nice sized chubb. It lifts my spirit and while I fish further, from time to time
another chubb comes in, alternated with some schneider.

I am having a good time and enjoy the wonderful scenery and the beauty of the river. After I have
passed the kingfisher pool, I throw my leader into a wonderful knot. Sitting on the bank I tie a
new one.

I move on to the land of two streams. I feel that there MUST be trout here. While I stand in
the river, cleaning my nymph, a few birds fly up from the shrub on the bank and there is some
movement there. I wait and then a roedeer steps out onto the gravel of the riverbed and jumps
on the bank of the meadow some yards further down. It all happenes about 20 yards away from me. 
What a great experience.
I catch several more chubb and schneider and YES, a brown trout. It makes me happy.

In the mean time the weather has improved and the rainjacket is put in the back of the fly
fishing vest.
With the sun on my back I really enjoy the fishing. At lunchtime we meet at the car. I have
had good luck. Frans did not do so well yet. He has been fishing a dry fly all morning. The
nymph seems to be favourite today. After eating a few rolls we go on fishing and I begin where
I ended in the morning. The place is easily found because there is a ford. From time to time
a chubb or schneider comes in, but also a couple of dace and even two minnows.
During a rainshower I seek shelter under a big tree. There is some movement in the calm piece of
water in front of me. I cast out and, to my surprise, get a nice trout. Half five we meet at the
car again and go to the hotel to get a schnitzel. Frans has fished a nymph too this afternoon and
has gotten some fish as well.

<br><br>
After the j�erschnitsel we go to the place where we usually fish in the evening. We get some
chubb and schneider and I catch another brown trout. I'm enjoying myself.
<br><br>
The beer we drink, sitting in front of the tent, tastes great. This evening we enjoy Paulaner beer
and Frans serves an extra bottle of his Sch�ferhofer.
<br><br>
Sunday we leave the camping place a bit before eleven o'clock. On the radio we hear that there
is a major traffic jam (12 km) on the A2 at Utrecht and another one on the A9. We avoid these
by taking another route and fortunately we reach Den Helder without any problems.
<br><br>
Despite traffic jams, heavy rainstorms and an average catch during the first two days, we have
enjoyed these days greatly. It's a pitty that we have to wait 9 months to the next trip.
We are already looking forward to it !!!
