<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

After reading an article about the Wied in the magazine of the Dutch Fly Fishers Association, my
friend Frans and I decided to check it out. The date was Thursday August 20th 1998.
<BR>
It turned out to be a lovely stream. Fellow anglers who only want to catch trout
and grayling better try their luck elsewhere, but those who have pleasure in catching
a nice chubb can have a good time here.<BR>
From central Holland, you get there by following the A3 (E35) via Arnhem, Oberhausen and Koln up to
exit number 35 Neustadt/Wied.

At Neustadt the river looks quite promising, but we followed the river upstream.
In the village of Burglahr one can get a day ticket at hotel Burghof, for 18 DM.
The beat is 2 km long and wading is possible over nearly the entire length.
There are lots of chubb, schneider, roach and barbel.</B>

<TD><B>The Wied at Dottesfeld. Very few trout but many chubb.
We saw a kingfisher several times.

Next day we went further and ended up at hotel Zum Wiedbachtal in Dottesfeld.
Here you can get a day permit for 17 DM and the beat is about 4 km long.
Once again, many chubb, schneider, roach and here Frans got the only trout of the trip.
The kitchen of Hotel Zum Wiedbachtal has a very good reputation.
Guests of the hotel also can fish the Holzbach, a brook which runs nearly in front
of the hotel.<BR>
