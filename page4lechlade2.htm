<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<b>Lechlade, friday April 29th 2005.<br><br>

Today the meeting is ended a bit early, and there is enough time left to go fishing for a few hours. In the hotel I quickly change and grab the fishing gear.
Epco, Joop and Willem will be dropped off in town, where they are going to look for a place on a terrace and a cool drink. With this weather that is a nice thing to do too, but I drive on to Lechlade. The weather is sunny and the temperature is pleasant. 

<br>
I have agreed to be back in the hotel between seven and half seven. I decide to get a 4 fish ticket. When I tell the manager that I have been here twice last december, he replies that I will find the situation to be different now. The trout are much more in the surface.

<br>
The car is parked at the parking lot at Bushyleaze lake, and I walk on to the spot where I got my fish during the last time. Some fish is showing in the surface from time to time, but I decide to start with a nymph anyway.
While casting the sound of my first cuckoo of this year is heard, followed a bit later by the sound of a woodpecker.
On the island a pair of Canada geese is breeding. Nice to watch. When the male comes flying in, he calls with the typical trumpeter sound.
During the first half our or so I do not get a take and therefor I move 10 meters to the left. I just saw a swirl there.

Another angler passes. He has not got a fish all day. After another 15 minutes my strike indicator moves and a few minutes later a nice rainbow of about 3 lbs is landed. I am very pleased with it.
A boat is moored on one of the buoys and one of the men in it, catches a nice fish.
When my nymph is fished back close to the bank, I get another take and tighten the line. The fish is on. But straight away I notice that this fish is fighting different than I am used to of the Lechlade trout. Two minutes later a small pike is lying close to the bank. When I want to take the fish out, it turns and is gone. Funny, a pike on the nymph.

After fishing for another half hour, I get the idea that I would like to try the little river. The Lechlade trout fishery has 250 metres of the river Leach. There you can try for wild brown trout, and it is catch & release. When I ask Jason, one of the managers, he tells me how to walk and gives me a tip or two on good spots.
When I arrive at the bank, the Leach turnes out to be a lovely small chalkstream. I think it is a pitty that I did not bring my waders. The water is overgrown on many places, so it means a challenge. When I want to lift the line on my first or second cast, a trout grabs the nymph, but is off straight after. The fish can't be fooled a second time.

A bit further I throw my whole leader in some branches. When I try to pull it out, even the braided piece of nylon stayes behind in the tree. So I have to knot a complete new cast. While I am busy doing so, a couple of peacock butterflies fly by, followed by an orange tip. Beautiful butterflies, both of them.

At a nice piece of water my cast stretche beautifully and right after the nymps touches the water a good sized trout dashes out of the bank to grab it. The strike indicator is invisible now and I miss the fish completely.
At the next cast I throw the lot in the branches again and have to get it out. Fortunately the tree is on my side of the river this time.
A while later I cast out again and the trout comes for the nymps a second time. This time it is hooked. It appears to be of a good size, and I have to ask another angler to assist with his net.
It is a beautiful fish and I am extremely pleased with it. Fishing on, I come to the end of the beat, indicated by a post.
Behind it, the water is private. Looks good too.

Bu now it is time to stop. An afternoon fishing like this is a real treat to me. I get back in the hotel well in time and when I get down in the lobby after a shower, the colleagues are there already. They too have had a nice day.
We head for the pub for a good meal. A steak and kidney pudding would be great.
