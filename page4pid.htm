<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<TD><B>The Culeaze beat on the river Piddle, not far from Dorchester.
A beautiful chalkstream. It's one of the beats of Wessex Chalk Streams Ltd.</B></TD>
<TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><B>Gin clear water, a good stock of (wild) brownies and a
wonderful environment with an abundant animal- and plant life.
The trout can be quite big, 4 Lbs or more! Wading is possible over nearly the
complete beat. There are some deeper pools where the trout can hide when the
waterlevel is very low, which can occur during late summer. Information on
accommodation, rates and such can be found on the homepage of <A HREF="http://www.goflyfishing.co.uk" target="new">

From my logbook, April 23rd 1995.

Yesterday we returned from Turkye, today we are off. So I went to the river 
Piddle. Because of the heavy rain the day before, the r. Frome was as brown as white
coffee. But the r. Piddle was in good condition to fish. The weather was very
nice. Later that afternoon I noticed that quite some olives were hatching, but
very few trout were rising. I started at the Culeaze farm and fished upstream.
Very soon I hooked two trout (on a nymph), but both managed to shake the hook 
out. A bit further 5 trout were niggled from under a holly tree, one after the other.
In the deep, narrow stretch, just before the little bridge at the upper end of
the beat I got my first big brown, 17 inches! A gem of a trout. Gave a good
fight during the drill as well. I hope the pictures turn out well.
From under the bridge I hooked another nice brown on a dry sedge. Between the
trout I hooked 2 salmon parr. I also saw a kingfisher, buzzard, arum, marsh marigold
and a blue flower which I did not recognize, and a roe deer.
The roe deer jumped away at the little meadow near the farm.
It was a wonderful day, lovely weather, piece and quiet, and i released some
trout.

This afternoon I went to the r. Piddle again. The water is now dead summer low and
the trout are very easily spooked. At the farm pool I get the first one, on a
gold head. I saw the trout come up and take the nymph.</B>

<TD><B>Fishing upstream I get another 5 on a dry sedge. Great!</B> 
<TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><B> 
I know a big trout to ly in a deep pool. I cast the sedge against the steep
bank and it floats calmly with the current.
Then a lot of things happen at the same time. A stinging fly bothers me by
buzzing near my ear and instinctively I try to chase it away with my hand.
Doing so I have let go of my fly line. At that moment I get a massive rise on the
sedge and I KNOW that it is the whopper. Miss ....... ruddy fly.<BR>
Fishing further I get two more trout from the downstream part of the beat.
Anyway, it has been a wonderful day. I also spotted a kingfisher again.

Apart from the beats on the rivers Piddle and Frome and the Sydling brook,
Wessex Chalkstreams has some nice lakes with stocked rainbow trout.
Because the lakes are fed with water from the Piddle and from  wells, the water is
gin clear and there are enough water plants which attract insects, and fish.
I have spent some time there and had a great time every time.</B>

<TD><B>The Oxbow, one of the smaller lakes. Because of its structure, it looks
a bit like a part of the river.
<TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><B>
The size of stocked fish is quite good, a rainbow of 3 lbs is nothing unusual
and some are double figures.
But besides a good trout stock, the lakes are very attractive because of the
scenery in which they are situated.
The area around Dorchester is beautiful, hills and valleys with brooks and the
rivers Piddle and Frome. Dorchester itself is a nice town to check out. Don't
forget the fishing tackle shop of John Aplin, who's river keeper for the
