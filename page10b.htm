<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

At last, mondaymorning august 14th, Frans and I are leaving for our trout fishing trip.
After arrival in Germany, we are told that works are being carried out upstream, which
cause the water to get very brown. We look at the clear water of the river and are taking 
a permit anyway. The evening is spent fishing, a few trout are caught. I am having one of those
moods and am losing my fly in the trees very often.

After a while my leader is a total catastrophy
and I have to put on a new one. Even the braided part has to be cut, because it is tangled and
damaged. After the fishing we drink a beer and go to bed early. Next morning, the water still
looks good and clear and we decide to buy another permit. After breakfast we decide to try our
luck at one of our favourite stretches. When we get to the river, Frans and I look to each
other sadly, the water has turned into the colour of white coffee and fishing is impossible.

We talk things over and decide to go elsewhere. It turnes out to be a good decision, although
we don't catch a lot of trout, the chubb and schneider are cooperating and we are having a lot
of fun anyway.

In the evening we are discussing the events of the day, while having one of the
locally bought white-beers. It is a moment that life is good.
Next day we decide to fish the same beat. We are catching fish regularly, but again there are
only a few trout in between.
A stoat is hunting along the bank and I can observe a fox for quite a while, something that
doesn't happen to me often. We see a kingfisher several times and also spot some dippers and
see foxglove, mint and other plants.
<br>The weather is very pleasant, only on the second day we get a rainshower, but that doesn't
last for long.</b>

At the car we cook our supper. After that we lie in the grass, gazing at the
clouds. Three buzzards are circling above the green mountains.
We want to fish another stretch and move the car. At a campingplace we step into the river and
it doesn't take long before the first chub is caught. Half nine we stop fishing. Back at the
tent we put a few beers into the cold river. We taste a few different white-beers. Frans favours
the dark ones most, I do like the lighter ones a lot as well.

It is very enjoyable, but we turn into the sleeping bags in time, tomorrow we have to drive the
whole way back home. 
Again we notice how fast these few days have passed. Although we had a bit
of bad luck in the beginning, a brown river, we have been able to enjoy the fishing a lot and
we can look back to this trip with much pleasure.
