<B>He told us about Christ's disciples being fishermen, and we were left to
assume, as my brother and I did, that all first-class fishermen on the Sea 
of Galilee were fly fishermen and that John, the favorite, was a dry-fly 
fisherman.<BR><BR>

<B>In August '95, we visited my friend David and his wife Pat. They showed
us a lot of Nova Scotia. There was time for fishing too and we had a 
great time at the St Mary's, the Margaree and some other places.
While we were fishing the St Mary's a pair of ospreys was soaring above us.
But we didn't see any salmon or brooktrout. Bob and I got a few little fish that
looked like chubb.</B>

<B>At the Forks Pool we saw a good number of salmon, but no brook trout. We met
a nice couple who advised us to go to another river in the area.</B>

<B>Early next morning I tried it on that river. The place turned out to be
a nice spot, only the lenght of the stretch where fishing was allowed was only 
about 100 yards long. Then a chain was put over the river, beyond which
fishing was prohibited. There was a large shoal of brooktrout waiting to run
upstream.

<TD><B>A bald eagle passed by at 50 yards range. A few brookies could be 
tempted to grab the goldhead pheasanttail.
It is a beautiful fish and they were released after taking a picture.
From the conversation with other anglers, it became clear that catch and
release is not yet common practice everywhere.</B>

<B>The Margaree Salmon Museum,</A> located at North East Margaree, certainly 
worth a visit. There is much to see, like a lot of old splitcane and greenheart
rods, antique reels, paintings, old flies and an aquarium with parr, smolts and
a few brookies.</B>
