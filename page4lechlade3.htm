<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<b>Lechlade, Sunday February 12th.<br><br>
<b>
A "cunning plan" developes in my brain. If we take an early flight, we can be in the hotel at noon. And if everything works out, I could be at the water at about two o clock.
But .... how do we get to Amsterdam airport that early? Public transport will not work for us. My friend Johan brings the solution, he is willing to give us a ride. Great !!!!!
<br>
Way before eight Gert-Jan and I arrive at Schiphol airport. The KLM flight goes smoothly and we land at Birmingham at ten. The collection of the hire car goes quickly and at twelve we are at the hotel. In a hurry I change into my fishing gear and go to Lechlade. It is a nice route to drive, the landscape is varying and I enjoy it. It feels great to be in England again.

The shop has been redecorated. There is a good collection of fishing kit, From rods to clothing. I buy a three-fish ticket and a few minutes later I stand at the bank of Bushyleaze lake. The weather is fine, a bit overcast, a temperature of around ten degrees Centigrade and a nice breeze over the water. 
Looking over the water it strikes me again what a beautiful fishery this is. Gin clear water in a beautiful environment. The two Canada geese are still here. Last year they did breed on the small island.
At the spot where I got a few trout last time I get no takes within half an hour and I move a bit further, into the corner. It appears to be a good idea, for at two I stand with a bending rod and the first rainbow is mine. A good fish of slightly over three lbs.
With this weather my goldhead nymph seems a good choice. After a while I decide to try it a bit further for a change. The wind blows straight into my face, which does not make the casting easier, but very often this situation has brought me fish. Passed the parking lot another angler catches a nice trout, and we talk a bit. When I move on, a trout boils close to the bank. Carefully I approach the spot and bring my line to length. Just before my the strike indicator is grabbed by a good fish, he takes it down a few metres. The next cast the same thing happens.

On my third cast I see a trout turn under it and so I shorten the cast. The nymph fishes now two feet under the surface. Shortly after I get a good take and after a nice drill trout number two can be landed, followed by number three within half an hour. Now I have to stop because I got my bag limit. I walk back and talk a bit with another angler. He tells me that the third fish does not count for my limit, because it is under two lbs. Good news for me, for now I can fish on a bit longer. The guy seems to have a good eye for fish, because it is slightly under two lbs when I weigh it in.
Trout number four does not let me wait long. Now it is near four o clock and I call it a day. I have to drive back to the hotel. Probably no need to remark that I am really pleased with this afternoon of fishing.

Wednesday it is made clear that we will end a bit early next day. A lovely thought and when we are done, I go to the post office to get an other Environmental Agency Rod licence.
<br><br>
Thursday February 16th.
<br><br>
After lunchtime we are off. In a great hurry I change and put the fishing kit in my little backpack. When I get to Lechlade I get a three-fish ticket again. Staff member Jason comes into the shop and we talk for a short while. Then quickly to Bushyleaze. When my rod is rigged I want to tie a nymph on and shocked I look into my backpack. In all the hurry to get here, I have left my flyfishing vest in my hotel room. So I head back to the shop and buy a few nymphs and strike indicators. Jason helps me out with a bit of nylon and soon I stand on the bank of Bushyleaze once more.
The wind blows hard into my face, and there is an occasional light shower. Although the casting is a bit awkward, I stay on this side of the lake. There must be fish here, for on my first cast the indicator moves slightly, but the fish is not hooked. On the second cast it is. But after a few minutes the the hook pulls out and the trout is gone. Ten minutes later the same thing happens. It is not good for my mood, but then again, it is fishing and those things happen. I do miss my own flies now. Not that no fish gets away with them, but since I tie them myself, nobody else can be blamed.
I get no more takes for a while and move down a bit. There I have seen another angler catch a few fish. When I pass him, we exchange a few words. Soon I get a take, and for the third time the hook pulls free. Enough is enough and now I change the fly. Not that I can see anything wrong with it, but just to be sure. Fifteen minutes later I make a long cast and fish it in very slowly while looking over the water. Then the rod is nearly pulled from my hand, so hard is the take. This fish is caught and later it turnes out to be slightly over three lbs.
In the mean time it has become half three. Another hour and I have to quit anyway. But again I get a nice take and the second rainbow comes in. By now I feel in a great mood again. After a cast more or less parallel to the shore I get another vicious take, as soon as I see the take the line pulls tight. One more trout of three lbs. Beautifully coloured.
After weighing the fish and filling in the form on the permit, I put it into the return box. The three trout are given to another angler. He accepts them with gratitude, so probably soon they will end up on a table some place.
