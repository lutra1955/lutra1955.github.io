<B>Long ago on chalkstreams, I decided that the best way of presenting a fly
to a trout and trigger off an impulse to rise, rather than to reconnoitre as
the "zone rangers" will have you do, was to get it in there quickly.<BR><BR>

<b>Friday 22 - Saturday 23 June 2001, Avon dam, Dartmoor.<br><br>
After arrival in Plymouth we have the afternoon off. Straight away to the fishing tackle shop
in Exeter street to get a day permit for tomorrow, which is valid for the rivers Plym, Tavy,
Meavy and Walkham.
The rental car is delivered at 1900 and as there was still enough time to go fishing, the decision
was made quickly. Bert, with who I share the cabin, liked to go along to have a nice walk.
In a booklet of the magazine Trout Fisherman a description of the Avon dam fishery is given.
No permits are needed, only a valid Rod Licence of the Environment Agency. 
The fishery is about fortyfive minutes driving from Plymouth. At the parking lot, there is a sign 
indicating the fishery. Nowadays (2010) you can't fish the river anymore with just the Rod Licence, 
but have to walk the 1,5 mile to the reservoir to fish.

A good path was weaseling through the valley, ending at the Avon dam reservoir. The booklet 
stated that it was a walk of about a mile, but it appeared to be at least two miles. 
Anyway, it was very beautiful summer weather and the scenery is breath taking. A wonderful valley
with rhododendron in full bloom with purple flowers, ferns on the hill and a beautiful burn. It 
looked like I was walking in a book of Rodger McPhail.

When standing still, I was attacked by herds of tiny midgets. Even the bug juice
didn't help much against these little critters. I fished a #12 sedge, and that worked out fine.
I got 9 little wild brownies and had a really enjoyable evening. At half nine we walked back to the
car and went back to Plymouth.
The country roads are something that you have to see yourself. Extremely narrow, sometimes the
mirrors touch the schrub of the hedges on both sides, when driving. All kinds of plants are 
protruding from the hedge, foxglove, ragged robin, cuckooflower and a lot of white flowers.
It is really beautiful. We also spotted a grey squirrel. Funny animals. Back on board I took a
shower and went to sleep straight away.

Saturdaymorning early up and on my way to the Plym.
The team of the fishing tackle shop advised me to go to Bickleigh, not far from Plymouth. The
river had ginclear water. Last weekend in France, I got a leak in my waders, and it appeared that the 
attempt to repair it, was not successful. The leak was in the foot-part of the wader and can not
be repaired. Fortunately I took my wellies with me as well.
The waterlevel was very low, but even in this circumstances, you can't get around with wellies very
well. Anyway, this morning I got two little brown trout. There were some shoals of seatrout 
present in the deeper pools, but they were extremely shy. One salmon was spotted, covered with
UDN. It appeared that there were not many brown trout around in the part of the river that I fished.

At noon I took off and went back to the Avon dam. The reservoir has a stock of little wild brown
trout. An 8 inch fish is a good size. When I arrived, some fish were showing in the surface and
so I started fishing near the dam. Soon a trout rose to my fly, I missed it. Several trout splashed
at my fly, without taking it. I missed a lot more than I caught. Perhaps that a smaller size fly
would have done the trick, who knows.
After a while I changed the sedge for a goldhead-pheasanttail. It was taken soon after by an 8 
inch wild brownie, that was landed and released. A few more trout were caught. The scenery at
the reservoir is smashing. It looks like a loch that Rodger McPhail has painted so 
beautiful in his books. There is only the sounds of wind and water, apart from a sheep or cow.
It has a kind of solitude that can be very attractive at times.
 At half six I called it a day, walked back to the parking lot and returned to Plymouth.
Back on board I had a beer and went to bed at 11.
