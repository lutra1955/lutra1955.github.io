<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

There is quite a difference between the weather forcasts on the websites of "Donnerwetter" and "wetter.com".
Frans and I talk it over, and decide to take our chances.
We leave Julianadorp at 11 and 1 hour, 40 minutes later we can enjoy the coffee at the AC
restaurant Roevenpeel at Nederweert. We intend to fill up autogas at the Shell station Barchon in
Belgium, but the LPG pump does not function. We fill up some petrol and take a detour to the
gas station on the other side of the motorway, where we tank some 25 litres of LPG. Then we 
proceed again in the direction of Prm. It all costs us half an hour extra, but fortunately we
are not in a hurry. We arrive at the camping ground at five. Great dissappointment, the river
is brown and unfishable.

After we have put up the tent and prepared our tea, we go and search for a place that can be
fished. Some 15 miles upstream, near Oberbettingen, the river is looking good. During our
recco we spot a roedeer and a squirrel crosses the road in front of the car.

When we wake up this morning, the river has cleared a lot and we get our permits at the
manager. As usual we start at the "killing fields", the rough part so named because wading is 
killing you there.
Because of the high water level, many places can not be reached with our waders. But within
15 minutes I catch the first brown trout. A bit upstream, where a concrete block lies in the
river, I slip and fall in the water. No wading stick could prevent this. After squeezing the
water from my socks I resume fishing and catch another trout. In the mean time Frans has got two 
as well
After lunch we walk the new path through the railway tunnel, to the beat at St Thomas.
There I get 3 trout and Frans got 2.
After our tea we go to the beat near Malberg. The schneider take readily and some 15 are caught, plus
a small grayling and two more trout.

Rain and thunderstorms during the night. In the early morning the river starts to colour, and
this gets worse by the hour. We will have to try if we can fish some place else and first go to
the Salmbach at <A href="http://www.molitor.com" target="new"><b>hotel Molitors mhle.</A>
<b>The brook is as brown as white coffee, perhaps we can go here in the future.
In the Gerolstein area it did not rain so severe and the Kyll river is still clear. 

<table>
<tr>

<b>
We go for a lunch at a snackbar and then quickly get a permit. It is nearly 1 pm already.
This afternoon Frans and I enjoy the fishing very much. We regularly get a beautiful marked
Eifel trout and the weather stays dry. At the end of the afternoon my wader starts to leak again.
A previously carried out repair obviously let me down. There is a tear near the heel, and this is
not easily repaired. I have to buy new waders. In the evening we enjoy a good meal with
schnitzel in hotel Haus Wehrbsh.

The river here is still very brown and we conclude that we
were happy to be able to fish at all. The beer at our tent is tasting great, we have a selection

The river is still brown and unfishable. We intend to get a permit at the shop of Willi Pfeil for 
the beat of 
<A href="http://www.fliegenfischen-kyll.de" target="new"><b>ASV Hillesheim.</A>
<b> 
First we make two calls at the tourist information. Willi Pfeil, as well as Winandy in Bitburg
tell me that they have waders in stock.
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>
We go to Hillesheim, if the waders fit we will be fishing within an hour. Pitty, the waders do not
fit and after we have got the permits, we can drive all the way back to Bitburg.
I buy new waders at Winandy in Bitburg and than we head back to Hillesheim. At Niederbettingen
the river is high and very slow, so we move to Dohm. There the river looks better.
But here too, many stretches can not be reached with our waders, the water level is too high.
Anyway, Frans soon gets the first few trout.

I move to the end of the beat, in the direction of Bewingen, and there a stretch is found which
is suitable to be waded and fished properly. I end up with 4 trout and two small grayling this
afternoon. A big fish, maybe a grayling of over 16 inches, gets away. I cannot hold the fish
when it moves downstream of me, than he spits the hook out. It took my strike indicator.
<br>Two kingfishers can be spotted, the first ones of this year, and a couple of dippers.

When we sit in front of the tent in the evening, bats swirl over the water and we hear several
owls calling from the forest.

<b>Thursday August 29
<br>
<br>
We pack the gear, stop by the supermarket to get some "Weiss-beer" to take home and leave our 
beloved "Kurort" at eleven. We are home at four.<br>
Looking back, we decide that it had been a good trip, despite challenges like rain and thunder, 
leaking waders and a brown river.
