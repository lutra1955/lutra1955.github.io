<B>I don't know exactly what fly-fishing teaches us, but I think it's
something we need to know.<BR><BR>

Flyfishing was already described in an appendix in the booklet "Hoe leer ik visschen" 
("how to fish") by Cor. Miss&#235t, second print, 1916.<BR>
There seems to be only one copy known in Holland.<BR>
In issue 63, autumn 2002, of the magazine of the VNV, the Dutch Flyfishing Association, a fine 
article about this booklet was written by Leon Links and Kees Ketting.
The material used was described as a pole of about 4 meters, to which a silk line was
connected. A dry fly was used, that was retrieved in the surface or slightly above.
This way of fly fishing is still used in Ireland in the mayfly season (dapping).
As far as known, it never was a common way of fishing in the Netherlands.

Although before the second world war the firm of K. Snel in Amsterdam was the 
official Hardy dealer in Holland , hardly any people were able to use a 
fly rod. Flyfishing in Holland really began around 1950. 
Dutch pioneers like Jos Peeters, Jan Schreiner and others found out that 
flyfishing was not only to be used for trout in other countries but also to 
fish for rudd in the clear waters of some of our "polders" (reclaimed lands).
But the learning process had its ups and downs. In those years the late Jan 
Roelofs wanted to demonstrate the "Flyfishing cast" with his spinning rod.
However, the spinnerbait ended up behind his ear and up to his death, he had 
to have the wound treated medically every year.
During the following years, flyfishing became more and more popular. Not only 
rudd could be caught on fly, other species could be taken as well.<BR><BR>

Nowadays flyfisherman go after, amongst others, fish species like rudd, roach, ide, 
bream, zander (walleye), pike, perch and brown- and rainbow trout.
<BR> 
In several places brown- and rainbow trout are stocked. Since more than 15
years it is possible to fish for wild seatrout, mainly in salt water.

Flyrods ranging from Aftma 1 to about 7 are used for the different circumstances 
the Dutch flyfisher can encounter. For most situations a 3 to 5 rod will do 
fine, but fishing a large streamer for pike requires a heavier rod.
A long rod (9 feet) can be a nice advantage when fishing in the polder or at
the IJsselmeer (Lake IJssel).<BR><BR>

Many of the well known trout flies are used. A big Palmer, size 8 to 12, 
was a popular fly in the early years of Dutch flyfishing, and still is today.
The Red Tag is a good choice, as is a sedge pattern.
Many nymph patterns will work well.
The streamers that are used to fish for pike often have a great resemblance 
to a worn out shaving brush.
<BR>
<BR>
Basically, you can fish a fly in nearly every water that is fairly clear.
<BR>
<BR>
You can make your choice between the canals or ditches in our polders, or go 
to the big rivers like Rhine, IJssel and Maas for instance.
Brown- and rainbow trout can be found in the Veerse meer, a sea-inlet that is 
dammed and now holds brakkish water. There are several put and take fisheries, the "Eemhof" is a good example.<BR><BR>

In spring, about half april, large shoals of roach and bream come inshore
on lake IJssel. A weighted nymph pattern like a Goldhead Pheasanttail will come
in handy then. <BR>
The Hofman marina at Den Oever is a nice place to fish in that period. It is 
essential to bring chest waders to fish the area properly.
Try to get local information before you go (or go to my links page and click on the site of Johan
Sibum), because the right time can be very short, it is all depending on the weather.
