<B>The real tragedy is the large number of rivers where the ecosystem is still
basically sound yet the wild-trout fishing is but a shadow of what it could be.

Friday June 21st.<br><br>

We rented a cottage for a week on the <A href="http://www.parkgerolstein.com" target="new">
<b>Waldferienpark Hinterhausen</A>, near Gerolstein.
On the website of the <A href="http://www.eifelfischer.de" target="new"><b>&nbsp "Eifelfischer" &nbsp</b></A><b>
was a description of the Oosbach, a brook not far from Gerolstein. I wanted to try it out.

At the river keeper, Mr. Gottfried Dienhart in Müllenborn, you can get a day permit, which costs
11 Euro.
Next morning I got out of bed at 5 am, to go fishing for an hour or two. The day started well
as I spotted a nice roebuck in a field down the road.
<br>
The water of the Oosback is crystal clear and very overgrown at most places. The trout is shy and
it is difficult and challenging fishing. The beat for guest anglers is not long, about a kilometre,
but it is enough to spend a few hours.

<b>The beat begins at the footbridge of Haus Feyen, at the camping ground, and ends just beyond
the railway bridge. There is only a limited number of permits available.

Soon I seduced a nice Eifeltrout with a dry sedge. The fish was very beautiful, darker than the
trout in the Kyll for example, and marked with bright red spots.
Because the water is so clear, you easily underestimate the actual depth. There are more deep
holes and channels than you think at first sight.

Half past eight I stopped fishing and went back to our cottage. I had caught and release six
beautiful spotted trout and was very satisfied.

Afterwards we went sightseeing. On one of the following days we spotted a red fox in a field, his
hunt apparently had been succesful. Near Oberkail a wildcat crossed the road just in front of the 
car, a unique encounter. We never dared dreaming to see a real wildcat.
About half of the German stock of wildcats is living in the Eifel mountains. They are very shy
and stay away from humans.
You can find some details on the website of <A href="http://www.treffpunkt-wald.de/1natur.htm"

<b>
Two squirrels passed by our cottage regularly on their foraging trips. A nice vieuw.
There were many finches, thrushes, blackbirds, big tits and blue tits in the wood, and also a
flock of crossbeaks.
On our sight seeing trips we saw several red kites and buzzards.
<br>
Two species of orchids were very common, they even growed next to the cottage, the Marsh Orchid
and the Lesser Butterfly Orchid.
