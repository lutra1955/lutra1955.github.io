The meeting takes longer than expected, and I'm home not before half five. Make a call to Frans straight away and then have my tea.
Half six the car is loaded and we head southward. The waterlevel is said to be 54 cm, and the weatherforcast is excellent.
<br>
It is already after nine when we reach the AC resaurant in Nederweert, and that is closed. It means no coffee for us. We fill the tank at Maastricht because Frans' car runs on LPG and a special adapter is needed when you want to fill the tank with LPG in Belgium.
A quarter to twelve we arrive at the camping ground. Twenty minutes later the tent is put up and our home-away-from-home is ready. First a beer and than a good night sleep. There is fishing to be done tomorrow!.
<br><br>
Thursday September 1st
<br><br>
We are up early and the first walk is to the sanitary facilities. After breakfast we first visit the supermarket to buy the groceries. Next thing is to get the fishing permits.
The weather is beautiful with a temperature of about 25 degrees centigrade. Full of expectations we rig the rods. For a change Frans and I swap the beats we usually fish each.

After a while I catch the first trout of the day, soon the second follows. When I get to the deep hole, I change the dry fly for a nymph.
A good choice, so it appears, because several trout are caught and released. In the gin-clear water I see how a nice sized rainbow inspects my nymph and leaves it for what it is. He is not to be fooled this time. When I get to the bridge, I leave the water, walk through the village and enter the brook again at a wooden bridge. Here the brook is overgrown and difficult to fish. From time to time a fish is taken from the many little holes. The bridgepool is a dissappointment this time.

I do see a few fish that bolt to safety straight away, with this low water level they are extremely shy and I don't catch many.
When it is time for lunch, I walk back. Fortunately Frans has driven the car to the picknickarea already.
After a good lunch I stretch out in the gras for half an hour, and then we go on.
The mill pool is for Frans and I pass it. The fishing is lovely, good weather and from time to time a little trout takes the dry fly. Wonderful!
At the end of the beat for guest anglers a kingfisher flies straight towards me and turns just before it reaches me.
For tea we have rice and goulash and after the coffee we enjoy a good hefe weissbeer. We start with a bottle Oetinger dark beer (great that you can get half a litre good beer for just 35 cents), which is followed by a Franziskaner for Frans (it is in the name probably) and Paulaner for me. We don't hear the owls this evening. Over the camping a magnificent starlit sky can be admired.

Friday, September 2nd.
<br><br>
We have planned to go to the Salm today. It is not so far to drive and it makes a change. At ten o'clock we are standing for the tourist information and the mair opens the door.
Yes, we can get a permit here. He tells us that there are many Dutch and Belgian anglers coming here. Lately it has been quiet though.
When we descent to the brook, the water turns out to be very low, very narrow and heavily overgrown.

It is difficult to find a place where you can even make a little rollcast. Frans had foreseen this and brought a very light spinning rod.
He does not think that the fishing will be worth while, and expects a "touristic stroll throught the river". He will be right.

The scenery is very beautiful here. The brook is in a "natural state", which means that it is a complete wilderness.
Every few yards trees have fallen over the brook and caused nice logjams.
To me it appears that with some work, you can make this a nice brook for flyfishermen too.
Only a few fish are seen, bolting to safety.

Before I can wriggle myself in a position to make a short cast, the fish have long gone. Very obvious with this low water level.
Under a bridge I spot a rise. Unfortunately I cannot make a cast because of a fallen tree and so give Frans a call. On his first cast he sees how his spinner is followed. On his second cast he feels a take, but the trout does not get hooked.
A bit further he catches a nice trout of about 30 cm. Although it is the only fish we get here, we agree that it is a lovely little river. Perhaps it is better in spring, with a bit more water.
The beat is only 1300 metres long and at lunch time we have fished it all.

We prepare lunch near the car which is parked at the pumphouse, and afterwards leave for the camping ground. We get a permit for the river Kyll and decide to go to the killing fields. If we had forgotten why we call this place so, it is brought to memory within seconds. The wading is killing here with all the big stones and rocks on the bottom, even with this low water. But soon I catch a trout, and a little later a second one that turnes out to be a brook trout. Nice to catch one for a change. At the end of this stretch of water I have caught and released 5 trout. Number six was a long distant release. Frans too has got a few fish. I wade across and climb up through the woods. Suddenly there is some noise of breaking branches, only a few metres away. When I look up I see how a roe deer jumps away. It seems that I have disturbed him in his nap. When I get to the water I start fishin. But it does not go fast. Some ten yards away a trout rises. With great enthousiasm I wade throught the river, go too deep and will have to walk in very watery waders the rest of the day. But the trout grabs my nymph and makes me a happy flyfisherman. It is one of a nice size, some 30 cm. After taking its picture, it is released.
<br>
After tea we go to the beat near St Thomas. Since a few years it is easily reached, because you can walk through the railway tunnel in Kyllburg. It is a very beautiful stretch of the river, but this evening no trout is seduced, neither by me nor by Frans.
However, we have fished pleasantly, and there is nothing wrong with six trout for this day anyway.

<br>
The choice of beers for this evening is the same as yesterday, and we like it a lot. Meanwhile, owls are hooting from the woods.

Today we go someplace else. It takes a while before the first fish is caught. It is a small dace. The nymph seems not in great demand and I change it for a dry fly. That appears to work better and I catch a fish from time to time. Chubb, a few dace, little schneider and some minnows. But at two-stream-country I catch a little brown trout. I am very pleased with it. To us it is ok to catch chubb and other fish, but I like it when there are some brown trout in between.
The landscape is smashing, the river is beautiful and the weather is nice, so I am having a very good time. When Frans and I meet for lunch he has got some fish too, with one or two good sized chubb.

After lunch and half an hour dozing in the grass, I walk to the slow piece of water at the camping place. Surely there must be some chubbe there.
The first fish I get is a nice dace. Here too a fish is caught from time to time, with a few nice sized chubb.
Too soon it is tea time and we head for the hotel for the traditional schnitzel meal. It tasts great, as ever.
After coffee we rush to the river again. I fish a piece of fast water that lookes good, but where I don not catch much most of the time.
This time, however, it is not too bad and I even get two little brown trout.
At half eight we meet at the car, dusk is rapidly falling in. It has been a good day. After taking a shower we take the stored beers from the river. They taste great. Once more first a bottle of Oetinger, followed by dark Franziskaner for Frans and dark Paulaner for me.

When you read the stories of the trips, they are very look alike. One time you catch a bit more than the other, and one time you see a bit more wildlife than the other. But to us these trips are something that we look forward to for months. During the passing of the years we have turned a bit less fanatic, sure. We used to fish till after sunset, when the water was pitch black. Nowadays we stop at half eight or so. We want to have the time to enjoy a glass of beer at the tent. Besides, we have not seen a decent evening rise her for years anyway.
.<br><br>
This year we have seen many kingfishers. Surely it were the same birds that passed us more than once, but every time it is nice to see.
We did not have to go far to see them, the passed us when standing in front of the tent.
Only once we saw a red kite, in Belgium on the way back. But on the other hand, the place teemed with buzzards, they were everywhere.
