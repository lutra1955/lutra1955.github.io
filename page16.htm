If the journal of Colonel Hawker is to be accepted, earlier anglers might have fished from 
horseback for gout seems to have plagued our fly-fishing ancestors, though whether this was
caused by bare-legged wading in their youth or the fruitiness of their fine Ports when older is
not clear.

Brest, June 16 - 17, 2001<br><br>
As soon as it became clear that we would visit Brest, in the province of Bretagne, 
a search on the internet provided a lot of information. The river Elorn looked good on the 
picture and on the AAPPMA website a good description of the river was given and addresses where
the necessary licence could be purchased.<br>
Friday afternoon we went ashore after work, and a fishing tackle shop was found soon.
Here licences were sold, but not for the area of the Elorn. Therefore we had to go to that 
particular area. The plan was changed to try to get a licence the next day in Landivisiau.
<br>
Saturday morning after a shower and breakfast, I went into town. First quite a walk on the base, then
by bus to the city centre and from there a short walk to the station.
Unfortunately, the train to Landivisiau was scheduled at about twelve o'clock. But the train to Landerneau was
departing at a quarter past nine. So first I went to Landerneau, that is situated between Brest 
and Landivisiau.

At the tabacco shop, mentioned on the internet, licences were sold. But not the "vacation card".
The stamps for that card were not held yet.
I went for a walk into the town. It is a nice place. There is a kind of old mill where the river
runs under with a nice rapid. There are little streets with cobble stones and there was a market
where all kinds of crabs and seafood was sold.
After a few cups of coffee at the station, I took the 11.30 train.

Fifteen minutes later the train arrived in Landivisiau. At cafe the "Elorn" licences were sold and
they also had the "vacation card". I was advised to try it two kilometres further down, and that is
where I went. The Elorn turned out to be a lovely river. Some parts remind me of the chalk streams
of Southern England, other parts look more like the streams in the Belgian Ardennes, or the 
German Eifel. All legal fishing methods are allowed, including worms and spinnerbaits, and so my
expectiations were not very high.

It was a pleasant surprise when, after twenty minutes fishing, a rainbow trout dashed out of the 
bank to grab my nymph. Beautiful fish. There were more trout around, and from time to time a
brown trout was landed and released. The day was ended with a total of 6 trout. About 5 or 6 
fish managed to jump off the hook. I like to use Tiemco TMC 103BL hooks, razor sharp and barbless.
But if a trout races towards you and you can't keep tension to the line, the trout often will manage to
shake the hook out.

The weather had been nice, dry for the major part, only occasionally a bit of rain. Sometimes it
was even sunny.
At about seven I called it a day and walked back to the cafe for a sandwich and coffee, I took
the train of half eight and was back on board at ten. After a shower I went to sleep straight
away.<br>
Sundaymorning early up again, even before the alarmclock. Bert, my cabinmate, was up also, he went
for a trip with his bicycle.
After a 15 minute wait for the bus I soon was at the station again and had more than enough time
to make a call home and catch the 10.30 train. Half an hour later the train stopped in Landivisiau
and I walked to the end of the river part that I had fished yesterday.

Two other anglers were present, and when I asked if they had any luck, they said something like
"its ok, not too bad". I guess they had caught their share.
This stretch of the river was very beautiful, it looked like a chalksteam, with all the
ranunculus waving in the current. A few trout were rising. Anglers who use spinnerbait probably
can't get around these parts, for they end up in the ranunculus with every cast.

One of the trout was lying under a piece of ranunculus and after a few casts, the sedge drifted
well towards its lie. The plants were moved with the current, the trout rose to my fly and took it.
After it was hooked it dived straight into the plants. I kept tension to the line and waded to
the place were the fish should be. To my surprise, it was still on and it turned out to be a fish
of 12 inch. After a while I got two more takes, but missed them. In a bit darker area under the
trees I got another take. When I set the hook, immediately a whopper of a rainbow trout jumped
clear of the water. It was between 20 and 24 inch long and the best trout I ever hooked on a river.
After a short battle the trout dashed through my thin tippet, and I found myself grumbling in the
middle of the river. Well, a few minutes later I found it pretty neat that I had the fish on for
a short while anyway. Another tale to tell. Fortunately I fished with barbless hooks, the trout
will shake the hook out in a few seconds. What a whopper was that fish, incredible.<br>
I got another little rainbow and two brown trout, bringing the score to two brace.

Near a tunnel under the road, there was a tree, hanging over the water. Ranunculus was growing
near its foot, that was standing in the water. I passed it while fishing downstream. When I waded upstream
again, a real big fish shot from under the tree and darted away with the current. Maybe a chubb.
I took the train of 18.30 back to Brest and was back at the naval base within an hour.

Next week, when in England, I have to buy a wader repair set, because I left that at home for a
change. In the afternoon I noticed that one of my waders was leaking. Probably caused by walking
through the bramble. And I have to ty a few more nymphs, because I have left a few in the trees.<br>
It is a petty that this river is quite a drive from Holland.
